# **To_Do_List
- This Python script leverages MongoDB to create a simple yet effective to-do list manager. 

- It connects to a local MongoDB database, todo_db, and manages tasks within the tasks collection.

- Users can add new tasks, view all existing tasks, or exit the program.

- With each added task, a unique MongoDB ID confirms the creation, and the "View Tasks" gives a quick look at everything on the list.
  
- It's a straightforward, console-based to-do list with persistent storage, making it ideal for basic task management.
